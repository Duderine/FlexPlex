🚀 FlexPlex

FlexPlex is an enhanced, agent-centric fork of Flexpilot. It is designed to transform the standard AI coding assistant into a fully autonomous engineering force.

🌟 Why FlexPlex?

While standard assistants are limited by static model lists, FlexPlex introduces a dynamic injection engine that allows users to link any OpenAI-compatible API on the fly.

⚡ Main Enhancements

Dynamic Configuration: All AI models are managed via config/custom_models.json. No hardcoded limitations.

Agent Sovereignty: Every model is pre-configured with high-level software engineering instructions to act as an autonomous agent, not just a chatbot.

Optimized Performance: Built-in cache clearing to ensure that your model updates take effect immediately upon restart.

🔧 How to Use
